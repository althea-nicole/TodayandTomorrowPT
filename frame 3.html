<font size="14">How does the virus spread </font>
</b>
</p>
<p align="center">
It spreads when a sick person coughs or sneezes. They can spray 
droplets as far as 6 feet away. If you breathe them in or swallow 
them, the virus can get into your body. Some people who have the 
virus don't have symptoms, but they can still spread the virus.
<br>
You can also get the virus from touching a surface or object the virus 
is on, then touching your mouth, nose, or possibly your eyes.
